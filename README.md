## Description

Welcome to our Flushy Website! This website allows users to find the nearest restrooms according
to their location. They can also click onto a specific restroom and see pictures and read reviews
about these restroom qualities. The purpose of this website is to ensure people have access
to convenient and sanitary bathrooms.
